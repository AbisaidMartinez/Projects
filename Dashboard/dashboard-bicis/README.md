# 🚲 Dashboard Open Data Visualization

An interactive dashboard for real-time visualization of open data on 
bicycle availability and station status in London. 
Built using **Streamlit**, **Folium**, and **Pandas**, this project integrates 
ETL processes with geospatial mapping to deliver a clean and responsive web interface.

## 📌 Project Overview

This dashboard connects to a public API to extract live data about bike-sharing
stations in London. It performs ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations to clean 
and structure the data, and then visualizes it using:

- 🐼 **Pandas** for data manipulation
- 🌍 **Folium** for interactive maps
- ⚡ **Streamlit** for web-based visualization

## 🔧 Features

- Real-time data extraction from open APIs
- Interactive map showing station locations and bike availability
- ETL pipeline for structured data ingestion
- Responsive dashboard interface with filtering options
